# 🚀 DevOps Git Project

A sample DevOps project demonstrating Git best practices including branching, pull requests, tagging, and documentation.

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

- `main` — Production-ready code
- `dev` — Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` — Short-lived branches for new features

## 🛠️ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyaman123/devops-git-project.git
cd devops-git-project
git checkout dev
